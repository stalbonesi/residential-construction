			About the map
			</subheader>
			<p>Many U.S. cities have experienced a rebirth over the past
			decade, as young professionals and families increasingly choose to
			reside in urban environments over suburban communities. New York
			City is no exception to this trend; since 2000, the city has added
			nearly 400,000 residents, spread across all five boroughs.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="eight columns">
			<p>This map provides a glimpse of where new residential
			construction is occurring across the city to accomodate the surge of
			city dwellers. Specifically, it identifies which neighborhoods have
			constructed the most new residential units since 2000. It is
			important to keep in mind that the numbers do not represent net
			change; rather, they only represent the aggregate number of newly
			constructed residential units, regardless of whether new units
			simply replaced older ones. All residential data was obtained from
			the NYC Planning Department's MapPLUTO database.</p>

			Manhattan
			</subheader>
			<p>Manhattan has constructed the most residential units of any
			borough since 2000 (81,518). The west side neighborhoods of Hudson
			Yards-Chelsea-Flatiron-Union Square and Clinton constructed more
			residential units than any other neighborhood in the city (14,679
			and 12,359 units, respectively). Much of this growth has been
			triggered by the completion of new open spaces such as the High
			Line and Hudson River Park. Rounding out the top five were Battery
			Park City-Lower Manhattan (5,933), Midtown-Midtown South (5,629),
			and Lincoln Square (4,981).</p>

			Brooklyn
			</subheader>
			<p>Brooklyn was a close second, having constructed 77,973 units
			since 2000. Leading the way was North Side-South Side
			(Wiiliamsburg) (9,115), followed by DUMBO-Vinegar Hill-Downtown
			Brooklyn-Boerum Hill (6,987). Williamsburg has become a preferred
			neighborhood choice among younger residents, and its historical
			industrial fabric has been rapidly replaced by new residential
			buildings. DUMBO meanwhile, has been transformed from a sleepy
			industrial area to an expensive mixed use neighborhood with
			desirable waterfront access, and Downtown Brooklyn has seen a
			residential high rise building boom that has further densified the
			area. Rounding out the top five were East New York (5,026), Bedford
			(4,551), and Bushwick South (4,523).</p>

			Queens
			</subheader>
			<p>Queens was a distant third, having constructed 55,643 units
			since 2000. Hunters Point-Sunnyside-West Maspeth constructed by far
			the most residential units of any neighborhood (8,434). Hunters
			Point accounted for the majority of the growth, having been a
			recent beneficiary of a city rezoning of much of the area from
			industrial to residential. The neighborhood was followed by
			Flushing, whose large Chinese population has been an active player
			in residential growth. Hammels-Arverne-Edgemere (3,150), Old
			Astoria (2,432), and North Corona (2,364) round out the top
			five.</p>

			Bronx
			</subheader>
			<p>The Bronx has constructed 37,826 residential units since 2000.
			The South Bronx neighborhoods of Morrisania-Melrose and Melrose
			South-Mott Haven North constructed the most units (3,991 and 3,209,
			respectively). City-owned properties that have been redeveloped
			under an area Urban Renewal Plan have accounted for a large amount
			of the growth in these neighborhoods. Rounding out the top five
			were Williamsbridge-Olinville (2,429), East Tremont (2,347), and
			Highbridge (2,307).</p>

			Staten Island
			</subheader>
			<p>Since 2000, 18,406 units have been constructed on Staten Island.
			Charleston-Richmond Valley-Tottenville - at the southernmost end of
			the island - led the way, with the construction of 2,236 units.
			While the area is relatively far from the rest of NYC, it still
			attracted several new large scale developments that accounted for
			most of the growth. The neighborhood was followed by neighboring
			Annadale-Huguenot-Prince's Bay-Eltingville, which constructed 1,621
			units. Rounding out the top five were Rossville-Woodrow (1,470),
			Mariner's Harbor-Arlington-Port Ivory-Graniteville (1,335), and
			West New Brighton-New Brighton-St. George (1,324).</p>
